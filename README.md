# A better way to prepare for coding interviews.

# Hi, I'm Abbas! ðŸ‘‹
I love to solve some popular coding questions in my free time and I am not expert in competitive coding as a matter of fact.I am trying to learn popular patterns in data structures and algorithms.


> It is better to start as early as possible!!

***Before starting your journey in solving coding problems I would request you to start with basics of any programming language that you love.***

***start with variables,conditional statements,loops,arrays,datastructures and finally oops.***

*I started to code in python while solving coding  questions but later I found that C++ is much faster than python and has some good libraries like stl and containers.So,I just started learning c++ and it took me a while to digest the syntax of this language.*

*Don't make the same mistake as I did earlier in my life.Stick with the programming language that you are good at but choose it wisely.*
